"(Virtualization network connection question): This gives the VM (also known as the guest) direct access to the hosting computer’s network connection. It allows external access, but in this case, the VM must have its own IP address on the external IP network. Because of the direct connectivity to the external network, this can be a security concern. In most cases, some type of NAT is preferred.": "Bridged networking",
"(Virtualization network connection question): Often the default, this gives the guest access to the external network, but by using ___, the guest gets a separate IP address on a private network.": "NAT",
"(Virtualization network connection question): This creates a private virtual network for the guests, and they can communicate with each other but not with the external network.": "Host-only networking",
"(Virtualization network connection question): This option disables networking for the VM altogether, which might be required for users who are working on confidential systems, testbeds, applications, and so on.": "No networking",
"What does NAT stand for?": "Network Address Translation",
"A _______ can be any environment created for development, testing, or training that is isolated from any production servers and isolated from the rest of the operating system that the _______ is running on.": "sandbox",
"A _________ is much simpler than a full virtual machine. First, it requires only a basic OS kernel. Second, it doesn’t require much in the way of virtual hardware. Finally, in most _________ systems, you can run multiple _________ on top of a single OS. Another important difference between a _________ and a virtual machine is usage. As mentioned previously, a virtual machine is used to run an entire operating system. A _________ is typically used to run a single application (and, less commonly, a couple of applications). Out of the box, _________ technology creates excellent isolation between applications.": "container",
